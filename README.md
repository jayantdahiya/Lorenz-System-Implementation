# Lorenz-System-implementation

Implementation of Lorenz system in python(Jupyter notebook) and Processing.


Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The model is a system of three 
ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations. The above implementation uses the same equations 
to graphically visualize and simulate the phenomenon of concept.

This system is also known to mathematically implement the butterfly effect phenomenon.




* .pdf file is a saved input and output of the python code implementation on the Jupyter notebook
* .py -- python code.
* .pde is processing source file of the same.
